## üìö Overview
A simple repo containing a global environment definition file to let you write write Stormworks Addon Lua projects in Teal, using Cyan.

Not usable yet, still porting.

- More info on Teal: https://github.com/teal-language/tl
- More info on Cyan: https://github.com/teal-language/cyan
- Info on a "global environment definition": https://github.com/teal-language/tl/blob/master/docs/declaration_files.md

## üíª Getting started
- Set up a project directory using `cyan`
- Download `lib/addon.d.tl` and put it at the top level in your project directory.
- Add `global_env_def = "addon",` to your `tlconfig.lua`. The result should look something like this:
```lua
return {
   build_dir = "build",
   source_dir = "src",
   global_env_def = "addon",
}
```
